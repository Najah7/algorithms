# Linked List

## Description
- Linked list is a form of a sequential collection and it does not have to be orderd.
- A linked list made up of independent nodes that may contain any type of data and each node has a reference to the next node in the list.

## Features
- ordered
- changeable
- indexed

## Words to know
- Node: an element of a linked list. each node has a value and a reference to the next node and is independent of other nodes.
- Head: the first node of a linked list
- Tail: the last node of a linked list
- Link: a reference to the next node

## Types of linked list
- Singly linked list
 - each node has a reference to the next node. singly linked list has a head and a tail. 
- Circular linked list
 - it is a singly linked list where the tail node has a reference to the head node.
 - Circular linked list is used for turn-based games, round-robin scheduling, and circular buffer ...etc
- Doubly linked list
 - each node has a reference to the next node and the previous node. doubly linked list has a head and a tail.
 - doubly linked list is used for undo/redo, navigation history, and LRU cache ...etc
- Circular doubly linked list
 - it is a doubly linked list where the tail node has a reference to the head node.

## Linked List in Memory
- linked list is located in memory randomly
