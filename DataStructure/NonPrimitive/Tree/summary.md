- **Edge**: Link between parent and child
- **Leaf**: Node which has no children
---
- **Height of node**: Number of edges from root to the deepest leaf
- **Depth of node**: Number of edges from root to the node
- **Height of tree**: Height of root node
- **Depth of tree**: Depth of root node
- **Level**: Level of node is its depth + 1
----
- **Parent**: Node which has children
- **Child**: Node which has parent
- **Siblings**: Nodes which have same parent
- **Ancestor**: Parent, grand-parent, grand-grand-parent ...etc
