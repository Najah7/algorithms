# AVL Tree (Adelson-Velsky and Landis)

## Description
An AVL Tree is a self-balancing Binary Search Tree (BST) where the difference between heights of left and right subtrees cannot be more than one for all nodes.

## Why AVL Tree
- It is a self-balancing tree, so it is faster than Binary Search Tree

## Rotation
- If at any time heights of left and right subtrees differ by more than one, re-balancing is done to restore this property. this process is called rotation.

## Cases of Rotation
- Left-Left Case: A single rotation is performed to balance the tree.
- Right-Right Case: A single rotation is performed to balance the tree.
- Left-Right Case: A double rotation is performed to balance the tree.
- Right-Left Case: A double rotation is performed to balance the tree.

## Operations of AVL Tree
- Creation
- Searching
- Traversing
- Insertion
- Deletion
- Rotation
