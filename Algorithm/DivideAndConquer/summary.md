# Divide and Conquer
Divide and conquer is an algorithm design paradigm which works by recursively breaking down a problem into two or more sub-problems of the same or related type, until these become simple enough to be solved directly. The solutions to the sub-problems are then combined to give a solution to the original problem.

## Property of Divide and Conquer
- Optimal Substructure: A problem has an optimal substructure if an optimal solution can be constructed from optimal solutions of its subproblems.

## Why we need Divide and Conquer
- It's very effective when the problem has optimal substructure property.

## Algorithms
- Merge Sort
- Quick Sortf

## Notes
- the  divide and conquer makes it shorter to write the brute force solution.
