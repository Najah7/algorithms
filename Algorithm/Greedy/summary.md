# Greedy Algorithm

## Description
- Alogrithm Paradim that builds up the solution piece by piece
- In each step it chooses the piece that offers the most obvious and immediate benefit
- It fits perfectly for those problems in which local optimal solution lead to global solution

## Example of Greedy Algorithm
- Insertion Sort
- Selection Sort
- Topological Sort
- Prim's Algorithm
- Kruskal's Algorithm
- Activity Selection Problem
- Conin Change Problem
- Factorial Knapsack Problem
