# Graph Traversal

## Types of Graph Traversal
- **Breadth First Search (BFS)**
    - Traverse closest nodes first.
    - Uses a queue to keep track of the nodes to visit.
    - It's used to find the shortest path in an unweighted graph.
- **Depth First Search (DFS)**: 
    - Traverse as far as possible along each branch before backtracking.
    - Uses a stack to keep track of the nodes to visit.
    - It's used when we already know that the target vertex is far away from the source vertex.
