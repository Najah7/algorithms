# Algorithms
- Algorithm: Set of instructions to perform a task
- Algorithm in Computer Science: Set of rules for computer program to accomplish a task
- Flow of Algorithm:
    - Input
    - Processing/ Calculation
    - Output/Stop when answer is found
- Metrics of Algorithm:
    - Correctness
    - Efficiency
        - Time Complexity
        - Space Complexity

# Type of Algorithms
- sorting: To sort data in ascending or descending order
- search: To find specific data in a data set
- graph: To represent a data that can be represented as a graph
- dynamic programming: To solve complex problems by breaking them into sub-problems
- divide and conquer: To divide a problem into smaller sub-problems and then solve each sub-problem independently and combine their solutions to solve the original problem
- recursive: To solve a problem by breaking them down into smaller sub-problems that are similar in nature
