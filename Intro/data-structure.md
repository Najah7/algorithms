# Data Structure
- Data Structures: different ways of organizing data on your computer, that can be used effectively.
- Data Structures â‰’ Organization of Data
- benefits: 
    - more efficient programs
        - find items faster
        - save memory ...etc
    - make it easier to write correct programs
        - we don't care about the details of how the data is organized

# Data Structure on Python
- Primitive Data Structures
    - built-in data structures in any given programming language
    - simple data structures
    - can't be broken down further
    - list of primitive data
        - integer
        - float
        - bool
        - string
- Non-Primitive Data Structures
    - complex data structures
    - can be broken down further
    - composed of primitive data
    - list of non-primitive data
        - Linear Data Structures: data elements arranged sequentially or linearly where the elements are attached to its previous and next adjacent in linear order.
            - List
            - Tuple
            - Array
            - Linked List
            - Stack
            - Queue
        - Non-Linear Data Structures: data elements arranged in a non-linear order where each item can be connected to more than one adjacent element.
            - Set
            - Dictionary
            - Tree
            - Graph
