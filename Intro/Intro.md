# Importantace of Algorithms and Data Structures

information processing has main parts of Computer Science

## Information Processing
- Information Processing: the manipulation, organization, and transformation of data or information by a computer or a biological system. It involves various stages like inputting data, processing or manipulating it through various algorithms or methods, and then generating an output or result.
- List of Information Processing Tasks:
    - Input
    - Processing/ Calculation
    - Output/Stop when answer is found
- Main Part of Information Processing for software engineers is Processing/ Calculation part, because processing/calculation rely on software more than other parts.

# Why Algorithms and Data Structures are important?
- Processing/ Calculation is almost Algorithms and Data Structures
- you can use Algorithms and Data Structures to solve problems, optimize processes, and improve efficiency of programs.

# Why are Data Structures and Algorithms in interviews?
- knowledge of Data Structures and Algorithms represent Problem Solving Skills of candidates.
- if candidates know Data Structures and Algorithms, candidates can learn new technologies easily.
