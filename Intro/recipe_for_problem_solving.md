# 5 steps for problem solving
1. Understand the problem
   - restate the problem in your own words
   - check inputs/outputs
   - make sure we have enough information to solve the problem
   - how should I label the important pieces of data
2. Explore concrete examples
   - start with simple examples
   - progress to more complex examples
   - explore examples with empty inputs
   - explore examples with invalid inputs
3. Break it down
   - write down the steps you need to take( comment out is useful)
4. Solve/Simplify
    - solve the problem if you can
    - if you can't solve it, solve a simpler problem
      1. find the core difficulty
      2. temporarily ignore that difficulty
      3. write a simplified solution
      4. incorporate that difficulty back in
5. Look back and refactor
    - can you check the result?
    - can you derive the result differently?
    - can you understand it at a glance?
    - can you use the result or method for other problems?
    - can you improve the performance of the solution?
    - how have other people solved this problem?
